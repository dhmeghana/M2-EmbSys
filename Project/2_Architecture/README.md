## Component Description 


* 7 Segment Display: Seven segment display is connected to PORT of microcontroller.The Output for the 7th level is not only shown on seven segment display but also indicated with a discontinuous buzzer sound.Output for the 8th level (i.e. tank full condition) is not only shown in seven segment display but also indicated with a continuous buzzer sound.


* BC547 NPN Transistor :The use of transistor is it acts as inverter i.e. in on state gives low voltage at output and in non conducting state gives high voltage at its output, all transistors outputs are connected to PORTS of microcontroller.

* Probe sensor :The Water Level Indicator employs a simple mechanism to detect and indicate the water level in an overhead tank or any other water container.
The sensing is done by using a set of nine probes which are placed at nine different levels on the tank walls with probe 9 to probe 1 placed in increasing order of height, common probe i.e. a supply carrying probe is placed at the base of the tank.

* Buzzer :
