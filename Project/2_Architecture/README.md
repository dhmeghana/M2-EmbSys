## Component Description

* Servo motor:
A servo motor is rotary actuator or linear actuator that allows for precise control of angular or linear position, velocity and acceleration.servo can rotate approximately 180 degree,it hasan operating voltage of 5 volt.

* LCD Display:
LCD screen is flat-panel display, electronic visual display that uses the light-modulating properties of liquid crystals and LCD's are available to display arbitrary images,preset words,digits,and 7-segment displays.

* Infrared sensor:
IR sensor which emits in order to sense some aspects of the surroundings.and it can can measure the heat of an object-as well as detects the motion.

* Gate sensor:
It consists of one reed switch and one magnet creating a close circuit.if IR sensor gives signal that magnet awy from the switch which breaks the circuit and triggers when the gate is in open state the function will won't work,it works only when it is closed state.

* Ultrasonic sensor:
It is economical sensor provides 2.5cm to 400cm of non-contact measurement functionality with a ranging accuracy that can reach upto 3mm.and it includes an ultrasonic transmitter,a receiver and a control circuit.



* EEPROM:
Here this is actually inside the microcontroller.

* MicroController:
This is the brain of the system here we use arduino uno every computation is done inside this controller it converts analog to digital and maps certain values, it controls LCD display, it sends PWM signals to servo motor.
