## Abstract


Automatic Smart car parking project aims at providing a confusion free and easy parking. This concept helps the drivers of the cars to park their vehicles with minimum wastage of time with accurate information of the availability of the space to park vehicle.Everything in the modern world is moving automatic system, we have built a system like that which can automatically sense the entry and exit of cars through the gate and then display the number of cars in the parking lot. This automated car parking system reduce the time taken to check the space for the vehicle by displaying the available space for parking on a LCD displayer. This project is developed using micro-controller arduino uno.


Features
|-------|
|Servo motor shall be provided to enter and exit of the car|
|Automatic gate opening and closing shall be provided by gate sensor along with IR signal|
|LCD Display shall be provided to know the working of the system|
|IR sensor shall be provided to detect the car that comes in front of the gate|

## SWOT ANALYSIS

 



## 4W'S  and 1H

## Who
person who need's to be parking 

## What
 automatic parking system aims to enhance the comfort and safety of driving in constrained environments.

## When
APS is used to navigate the driver to reach the desired space and in an effective manner, thus reducing search time.

## Where
APS is required for malls,hospitals,IT companyies,restaurants,etc.
 
 ## How

In APS the cars entering and exiting with sensors and actuators process.


## High level requirements

|ID|Description|
|--|----------------------|
|HLR_1|It shall controll automatic entry and exit of the car.|
|HLR_2|It shall count the available space for parking.|


## Low level requirements
|ID|Description|Category|
|--|------------|---------|
|LLR_1|SERVO motor operates based on the instructions of IR signal|HLR_1|
|LLR_2|IR sensor detects the motion of the car|HLR_1|
|LLR_3|Gate sensor to automaticaly open and close gate based on the instruction of IR signal|HLR_1|
|LLR_4|Ultra sonic sensor count the available space for parking|HLR_2|
|LLR_5|LCD display's output of working for the instructions of sensors|HLR_2|



## State of art

An automated parking system is a area or volume required for parking cars. Automated Parking System provides parking for cars on multiple levels stacked vertically to maximize the number of parking spaces while minimizing land usage. so we have deployed a microcontroller which is used to sense the movement of cars and it either Free space is there or not. It is possible to free space when any car enters in the parking lot or close the gate when a car exits from the parking lot. The sensing of entry and exit of cars is done with the help of IR transmitters and receivers. This change in output is sensed by the microcontroller and accordingly it increments and decrement the count and opens the gate if there is space. The procedure for the exit of the cars is similar as the entry.



## Applications
* The automatic car parking system could be used for residential buildings,hotels,offices,shopping center,show rooms,universities,government buildings,airports,hospitals,and stadium,etc.
* The scope of this project is vast in the area automatic of car parking and vehicle security.
